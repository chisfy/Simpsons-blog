<p align="center">  
This was my first introduction into React! A simple blog single-page app where you can post and comment.
</p>
<p align="center">  
This mini-project included include making components like BlogPost, Comment, CommentList, and CommentForm whilst utlizing the UseState Hook and props. <br>
</p>
<p align="center"> 
As this was my first mini project that was deployed, I decided to use this to practice docker and undersatnd containerisation and how to dockerise an app!

## 🏫 Lessons Learned

<p align="center">
Better understanding of the architecture used in React, how to implement useState and props, specifically prop drilling!
</p>
<p align="center">
Understanding of JSX and Javascript and how they work with each other
</p>
<p align="center">
Better understanding of responsive design! This app works well in transition between screen sizes, the mobile and desktop work too!
</p>
<p align="center">
How to use docker, the process of creating images and containers so that an application is ready for deployment with a cloud service. I also learn thow to create containers for two enviroments; development and production - with development hot loading is vital to ensure changes are visible and working to the containerised version of the app.
</p>

## 💭 Reflections
<p align="center">
What went well? <br>
The strongest part of this application is the responsive design, it was built mobile-first!
I enjoyed building this!
</p>

<p align="center">
What could be improved? <br>
Complexity of app, it's a small project so there's always room for another feature I could implement!
