## 🏫 Lessons Learned

<p align="center">
Better understanding of the architecture used in React, how to implement useState and props, specifically prop drilling!
</p>
<p align="center">
Enhanced understanding of TypeScript and its syntax, especially when used with useContext.
</p>
<p align="center">
Better understanding of responsive design! This app works well in transition between screen sizes, the mobile and desktop work too!
</p>

## 💭 Reflections
<p align="center">
What went well? <br>
The strongest part of this application is the responsive design, it was built Mobile-first!
</p>

<p align="center">
What could be improved? <br>
Complexity of app, there's always room for another feature I could implement! Overall, it has been a good introduction to TypeScript.
CSS styling; improvement and a better approach to positioning elements rather than relying solely on divs.
Testing; I have yet to implement written tests, relying on developer environment testing and deployment checks.

The React Recap Task was a guide to creating a blog app using React. Before you start, it suggests checking out some React docs. The tasks include making components like BlogPost, Comment, CommentList, and CommentForm whilst utlizing the UseState Hook and props. For example, CommentForm lets users submit comments, and App brings everything together. It says to take it step by step, plan things logically, and use npm start to see your progress. The goal? A cool blog app where you can post and comment.
